hfdp - Head First Design Patterns
---------------------------------

#### Strategy 	- Chapter 1. Welcome to Design Patterns  
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.  

#### Observer    - Chapter 2. Keeping your Objects in the know.  
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between 
objects so that when one object changes measurements, all of its dependents
are notified and updated automatically.

#### Decorator   - Chapter 3. Decorating Objects.  
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object
dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing 
for extending functionality.

#### Factory     - Chapter 4. Baking with OO Goodness
