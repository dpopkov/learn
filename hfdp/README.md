hfdp - Head First Design Patterns

Strategy 	- Chapter 1. Welcome to Design Patterns  
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.  

Observer    - Chapter 2. Keeping your Objects in the know.  
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between 
objects so that when one object changes measurements, all of its dependents
are notified and updated automatically.
