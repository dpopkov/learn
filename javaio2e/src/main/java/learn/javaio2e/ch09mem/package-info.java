/**
 * 9-1. SequencePrinter - reads a series of filenames, creates a sequence input stream.<br>
 * 9-2. FibonacciFile - uses a byte array output stream to implement a simple form of buffering.<br>
 * 9-3. FibonacciProducer - writes data onto the output stream that it's given in the constructor.<br>
 * 9-4. FibonacciConsumer - reads integers from its input stream until the stream is exhausted.<br>
 * 9-5. FibonacciDriver - creates a piped output stream and a piped input stream and uses those
 *                        to construct producer and consumer objects.<br>
